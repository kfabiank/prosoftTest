Bugs Identified: 

1.Dates calculation, I need to double check the date calculation given an start day and numbers of days
2.Date Rage is been calculated but is not working yet in the calendar rendering, with more time I will be able to create an array of days to call the endpoint and return the data I need.
3.Country code is been passed as parameter to the API buy for example if I pass CR and US is currently returning holidays for US only. With more time I may need to make some test and find more documentation.
4. Calendar is been generated, however I did not have time to generate only the month requested, so I’m adding arrows to navigate between months.

This that need more doc or requirements,
